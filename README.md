Global Data
===========

This is a prototype for a collaborative project between James Edwards, Kim Marquardt, and Kinetech.

The code for rendering a graph on a sphere was obtained from the [Graph-Visualization](https://github.com/davidpiegza/Graph-Visualization) project by David Piegza.

The code for the globe was taken from the dataarts [webgl-globe](https://github.com/dataarts/webgl-globe).
